\section{Changelog}
\textbf{November 8, 2020}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove ``golden age of travel" from Q1 Days 18-20; Change ``Early American Airlines"
    to ``First Airlines in America"
    \item Change Q3 Day 1 topic to ``Early Airlines" with a greater focus on airlines than aircraft
    themselves. Will discuss individual aircraft types in conjunction with their role in each
    airline.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{February 20, 2021}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove ``Aircraft Identification" topic; not something that's very important; more of a hobby than historically relevant. 
    \item Remove ``Modern air mail and shipping" topic; not much content here, and the main point is that most air mail is carried by cargo on passenger flights. 
    \item Adjust timeline to include extra catch-up days. 
    \item Adjust formatting and section numbering of this plan for easier readability. Add hyperlinks to TOC. 
\end{itemize}

\textit{This course plan is subject to change any time at the discretion of the instructor or student.}

\section*{Introduction}

In this course, the student will focus on various events in the history of aviation. Emphasis
will be put on the effects on various people around the world.

This course plan will outline specific learning activities and agendas per class period.
There are about 21-22 class periods per quarter. This plan assumes that each class period
will meet for the scheduled 88 minutes. The schedule is subject to change and will leave
some leeway in order to account for unforeseen circumstances such as fire drills, delays, etc.

Each day, the student will research the planned topics, take notes, and write webpage
articles pertaining to the topics. Notes will be organized into a GitHub repository, and
webpage articles will be continuously updated.

\section*{Summer Assignment}

The final project of this course is actually an ongoing effort. By the end of the year, the
student will have constructed a fully functional informative website detailing what they have
learned. Because of the magnitude of the project, the student will set up the backbone of
the website before the beginning of the year.

The student will use HTML and Bootstrap to construct the website layout and structure.
It will be hosted through GitHub Pages. The student will also construct an article template.
This way, the student will be able to quickly update the website during the year.

\section*{Methods of Assessment}

Throughout the course, there are planned days for assessment and review during each
quarter. At the end of each quarter will be another assessment day. During these assessments,
the student will reflect upon the progress they have made and possible improvements. This
will be expressed in a written reflection. The student will then review what they have learned
and participate in an oral discussion with the instructor. The instructor will pose questions
to the student and the student should respond in an appropriate and correct manner.
