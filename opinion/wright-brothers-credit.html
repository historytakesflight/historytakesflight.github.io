                    Ask the average person what the Wright brothers were known for, and they will almost certainly tell you that they invented the airplane. Chances are, 
                    they’ve never heard of Armen Firman, George Cayley, Octave Chanute, Samuel Langley, or any other aviation pioneer. The Wright brothers get all the 
                    credit. Do they deserve it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most historians agree that the Wright brothers were indeed the first to sustain a powered heavier-than-air aircraft in flight. This is a very specific 
                    achievement. To say that the Wright brothers invented the airplane is an oversimplification. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without any prior context or knowledge of the many aviation pioneers who came before the Wright brothers, it’s quite easy to come up with the notion 
                    that the Wright brothers suddenly got the idea to fly and just made it work. The truth is far from that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Wright brothers would not even have considered trying to fly had Wilbur not heard of Otto Lilienthal’s death in a gliding accident. Wilbur and 
                    Orville themselves acknowledged the crucial role others played in their success:

                        It was not till the news of the sad death of Lilienthal reached America in the summer of 1896 that we again gave more than passing attention 
                        to the subject of flying. We then studied with great interest Chanute’s “Progress in Flying Machines,” Langley’s “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” 
                        the “Aeronautical Annuals” of 1905, 1906, and 1907, and several pamphlets published by the Smithsonian Institution, especially articles by 
                        Lilienthal and extracts from Mouillard’s “Empire of the Air.” The larger works gave us a good understanding of the nature of the flying problem, 
                        and the difficulties in past attempts to solve it, while Mouillard and Lilienthal, the great missionaries of the flying cause, infected us with 
                        their own unquenchable enthusiasm, and transformed idle curiosity into the active zeal of workers.

                    It’s clear that the Wright brothers were able to stand on the shoulders of the giants who came before them, which enabled them to learn from their 
                    mistakes, try their designs, and otherwise gain from several decades of knowledge available to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And let’s not forget that the Wright brothers spent years fighting over patent rights, trying to make the Curtiss Company stop producing airplanes. 
                    Sure, they were the inventors, but was that really necessary? It leads to the question of who science belongs to. Should advances in science be made 
                    public to everyone? There’s no denying that when scientific achievements are made very public, it opens up the opportunity for others to review their 
                    work and improve upon it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to the Wright brothers, aviation pioneers (see: Octave Chanute) were very open and transparent about their work, and tried to make their resources 
                    as available as possible. Recall that Wilbur Wright personally wrote to the Smithsonian institution to request their materials on flight. Needless 
                    to say, the Wright brothers would have gotten nowhere had they not had those resources available to them. So should they have been so secretive about 
                    their achievements? It certainly seems selfish. And had they asked Mr. Curtiss cordially to respect their rights to their invention, the situation may 
                    very well have turned out productive for all parties. Instead, they engaged in years of lawsuits and court battles.

                <p>
                    Not to diminish the success that we know the Wright brothers had, we need to stop perpetuating the image of the Wright brothers as amazing miracle workers 
                    who never did anything wrong. Too often in history, we see people for a single aspect of their entire lives. We can’t know everything about everyone, and 
                    that is usually fine. But when it comes to the Wright brothers whom we give so much credit and recognition to, we need to take a more well rounded view to 
                    their lives in order to get a better understanding of aviation as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2018, The News Wheel, an automotive news website, published an <a href="https://thenewswheel.com/why-north-carolina-needs-to-take-first-in-flight-off-its-license-plates/">article</a> arguing that North Carolina should not have the slogan “first in flight” on its 
                    license plates. It turns out that there’s a long-standing dispute between Ohio and North Carolina: Ohio license plates are printed with “birthplace of 
                    aviation”. In truth, this argument is petty and stupid. Neither of these states deserve to have any of these phrases on their license plates. Although 
                    the Wright brothers lived in Dayton, Ohio for much of their lives and flew their first powered flight in Kitty Hawk, that doesn’t make North Carolina 
                    “first in flight” or Ohio the “birthplace of aviation”. Those titles are far too vague and belong to other 19th century aviation pioneers who aren’t 
                    the Wright brothers.
