                    One and a half trillion dollars. That is a crazy number to imagine, and it's what the F-35 program is expected to cost 
                    throughout its lifetime. For scale, in 2012, an HUD spokesperson told the New York Times that the annual cost to 
                    ending homelessness in the United States would be twenty billion dollars. An October 2020 study estimated that it would 
                    cost three hundred and thirty billion dollars to end world hunger by 2030. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The F-35 program was started to develop a "Joint Strike Fighter"; that is, a fighter jet that could be used by the Air 
                    Force, the Marines, and the Navy. But, it turns out that creating such a jack-of-all-trades has its inherent problems. 
                    Each division of the US Military had its own requirements and desires of what such an aircraft should be capable of. As 
                    a result, it becomes a master of none and quite mediocre overall. When pitted against an F-16, pilots found the F-35 to 
                    be less maneuverable and underperforming. A study done by RAND found that the F-35 program would actually be more expensive 
                    than each branch creating their own fighter jet to suit its own needs.

                    Lockheed, as well as the government, argues that the F-35 was designed as a stealth-first aircraft, which should justify its 
                    lacking performance. It turns out that even in stealth, it might not be very good. Using modern radar, the aircraft's cross 
                    section was significantly reduced, but using older technologies or alternate detection methods, the aircraft is still quite 
                    vulnerable. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Riddled by delays, unexpected costs, technical malfunctions and even dangerous situations, the F-35 has received its fair 
                    share of criticism. Why is it continuing? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be fair, the program has improved significantly over the course of its existence. Lockheed has been consistently delivering 
                    aircraft, and many of its technical issues have been dealt with and resolved. But the F-35 symbolizes the state of the 
                    military-industrial complex in the US. The government spends a lot on defense. Former president Trump, along with Congress, 
                    allocated 705.4 billion dollars to the Department of Defense for Fiscal Year 2021. Again, that's an almost unfathomable amount of 
                    money. The absurd spending we put towards defense and programs like the F-35 have been intensely scrutinized by politicians, who 
                    call for large military spending cuts. However, it's not as easy as simply waving your hand and reducing spending. Bernie Sanders, 
                    one of the loudest voices in this camp, offers plenty of reasons - unnecessary wars in the Middle East (at the cost of civilian 
                    lives), ultra-wealthy defense company executives, etc. These are all great reasons and they make sense, but he gives no clear plan 
                    of getting any of these things done - and understandably so. The first issue is that you would not be able to get much support for 
                    a budget cut in Congress. Most defense bills are passed with bipartisan support, and if the majority of Democratic politicians 
                    support current defense bills, it's highly unlikely that a reduced one will pass. Next, the defense industry is deeply tied in 
                    trade, the economy, and the jobs of millions of Americans. It will be impossible to make a drastic change in funding without 
                    causing a penetrating ripple effect. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We absolutely spend way too much money on the military. People are killed every day because of this, American or not, civilian or 
                    military. The F-35 is a great example of our wasteful attitude towards most things military. It makes a lot of sense as to why we 
                    should try to spend less money on these kinds of programs; we just need to be more careful about it - it's not as simple as people 
                    make it out to be.
