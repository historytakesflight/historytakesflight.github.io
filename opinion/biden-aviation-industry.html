                <p>
                    After a long, drawn out and intense election week, Joe Biden is now the president-elect of the United States. What does this mean for the aviation industry?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When nations began locking down due to COVID-19 in March 2020, airlines were hit especially hard by the resulting economic downturn and sharp drop in travel 
                    demand. Airlines began to quickly burn cash as their operating costs far exceeded revenue. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
                    Security Act (CARES) was passed in an attempt to stabilize the economy and prevent job losses, among other causes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The law allocated up to $25B for passenger airlines, $4B for cargo airlines, and $3B for contractors; the money was to be used to ensure that employees could 
                    keep their jobs and benefits. One of the conditions of the bailout was that companies "refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing pay rates 
                    and benefits until September 30, 2020" (&sect; 4114).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The three major American legacy airlines - American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines - received $5.98B, $5.6B, and $5.1B respectively. 
                    Nevertheless, as the Payroll Support Program period ended, American and United collectively furloughed over 32,000 employees on October 1, 2020. 
                    This doesn’t even include other mainline airlines, regional airlines, or low cost carriers.
                </p>

                    Without pointing fingers about why airlines lacked money to support their employees in a notoriously cyclical industry, it’s clear that American 
                    families are suffering. Joe Biden has committed to extending pandemic unemployment benefits, and helping currently employed Americans remain at work. 
                    For now, we need congress to put political differences aside and pass a second stimulus bill to help those being hit hardest by COVID-19 related 
                    economic difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The airline industry is one of the few remaining heavily unionized industries. Negotiations between airline employee unions and airline executives 
                    have allowed some airlines to avoid furloughs completely. Biden supports "strengthening public and private sector unions and helping all workers 
                    bargain successfully for what they deserve". 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we should all be aware that these are all band-aid solutions that don’t fix the root cause of our problems. Until the COVID-19 pandemic 
                    is under control (which it certainly isn’t), our economic struggles will continue. Travel demand won’t come back for a while, so airlines are now 
                    tasked with trying to convince their customers that flying is safe. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We cannot deny that the current president has failed to effectively take control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Constant anti-mask rhetoric, downplaying, 
                    and distrust in experts has led a public health crisis to become politicized and divisive. Unfortunately, a lame duck president will likely be even 
                    less motivated to take control of the current situation. COVID-19 cases are breaking records daily, with over two hundred and forty-two thousand 
                    American lives lost. The president no longer cares about the pandemic, and to him, there doesn’t exist a reason for him to care. He hides behind 
                    his Twitter account, sowing distrust in the results of the election, refusing to concede, and completely missing an opportunity to fix his damaged legacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joe Biden, on the other hand, has a clear cut plan for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. He will listen to the experts and scientists. He will make well 
                    informed decisions in the name of public health while making efforts to reduce economic harm. No, Joe Biden will not shut down the country again:

                        Social distancing is not a lightswitch. It is a dial. Joe Biden will direct the CDC to provide specific evidence-based guidance for 
                        how to turn the dial up or down relative to the level of risk and degree of viral spread in a community, including when to open or close certain 
                        businesses, bars, restaurants, and other spaces; when to open or close schools, and what steps they need to take to make classrooms and facilities 
                        safe; appropriate restrictions on size of gatherings; when to issue stay-at-home restrictions.

                <p>
                    A Biden administration could also mean improved airport infrastructure. The Biden campaign issued the following statements:

                        Aviation and airports are major drivers for the U.S. economy, but our airports are in desperate need of improvement. As president, Biden will 
                        double funding for airports through the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Airport Improvement Program, and launch a new competitive grant 
                        program for major airport renovation projects. At the same time, he’ll also make sure that the U.S. maintains the world’s safest aviation system, 
                        working with the FAA to fully implement its NextGen technology system, to improve safety, modernize our airspace, and reduce delays and cancellations. 
                        Biden will also ensure that U.S. airlines’ operating, repair, and maintenance facilities overseas adhere to our nation’s highest safety standards.

                    Improving airport infrastructure will allow for better passenger experiences in airports, as well as job opportunities for many. Improved airports could 
                    also be a contributing factor in increasing travel demand.

                <p>
                    One of the major talking points during this election season was the environment and clean energy. It’s no secret that air travel is a major source of 
                    pollution. In fact, aviation itself accounts for 2.4% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. Aside from CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, jet engines produce 
                    harmful combustion byproducts, as well as water vapor which is also a greenhouse gas that contributes heavily to global warming. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    No commercial aircraft type currently runs fully on alternative energy, and it will take a long time to get to that point. One notable example of 
                    clean energy in aviation is United Airlines’ partnership with LAX airport in using biofuels on commercial flights. This is a very specific case, and most 
                    aircraft still run on fuels derived from crude oil. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the second presidential debate on October 22, 2020, Joe Biden said that he wanted to "transition from the oil industry". While investing in sustainable 
                    and clean energy sources is paramount to mitigating effects from the ongoing global climate crisis, we must acknowledge that the aviation industry depends 
                    heavily on the oil industry. Although a blatant ban on fossil fuels is near impossible, consider the impact it will have on the aviation industry in particular.

                    The aviation industry is incredibly complex. It can be affected by the largest or smallest change in demand, fuel prices, or a host of other dependencies. Flight is crucial 
                    to our global economy and society, yet it is mostly ignored by politicians. They need to understand that their actions and decisions will be felt by millions 
                    of Americans who are employed in various aviation related fields. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a final note, most of us are painfully aware of the lofty goals and promises politicians make, most of which will never be fulfilled. This is probably true 
                    for our incoming president. We should also keep in mind that Joe Biden will not be sworn into office until January 20, 2021 given a peaceful transfer of power.
