                <p>
                    The role of strategic bombing in war was heavily emphasized by airpower theorists during the time between the First World War and WWII. 
                    People such as Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell, observing how aviation was used during the First World War, were convinced that aircraft 
                    would be critical in future wars. Douhet asserted that civilian morale was fragile, and that bombings would make any country want to 
                    surrender almost immediately. He also insisted that heavy bombers would almost always be able to punch through enemy air defenses. Mitchell 
                    emphasized the necessity of using bombs to target enemy industry, particularly aircraft production plants. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many predictions of airpower theorists turned out to be wrong, but the armies of World War II kept in principle with the emphasis of heavy 
                    bombers. The B-17 and B-24 served that purpose primarily in Europe, the pacific needed more. The B-29 Superfortress was a heavier, more 
                    powerful, and longer-flying beast of engineering beauty that ended up being a critical and worthy return on a risky investment by the US. 
                    As mass production began before testing was complete, the US Army Air Forces were hoping that the aircraft had no major design flaws and 
                    that it could be used immediately.

                <p>
                    One of the primary factors barring the effectiveness of bombers was their lack of accurate navigation and targeting systems. In order 
                    for a bombing to do the most damage, the bombs need to hit where you intend them to. The B-29 improved on this issue by implementing 
                    its own stand-alone systems. The B-29 was almost twice as heavy as the B-17, and its maximum range was over 2,000 miles more. The B-29 
                    features better gunnery, well increased bomb loads, and a pressurized cabin. It could also fly much faster than the B-17. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These features made the B-29 important in the Pacific, where aircraft needed to fly very long distances to reach Japan, with few Allied 
                    bases within combat range. In fact, the role of the B-29 was almost exclusively aimed towards Japan. The B-29 was used extensively in 
                    bombing Tokyo, where they were able to wreak havoc on Tokyo's industry with minimal losses. Their strategy of using B-29s with explosive 
                    incendiary bombs was expanded throughout Japan. On March 9, 1945, 330 B-29s bombed Tokyo in what turned out to be the deadliest air 
                    raid of WWII.

                <p>
                    On August 6th and August 9th, 1945, modified B-29s Enola Gay and Bockscar dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and 
                    Nagasaki, eventually leading to the surrender of the Japanese. The airplanes were modified such that they would operate with a minimal 
                    crew, and much of their defensive armaments were removed to save weight. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the B-29 was a technological leap forward in heavy bombers, with numerous performance and load improvements. It was a crucial 
                    factor in the Pacific, considering its range and speed. Combined with incendiary bombs and atomic weapons, the B-29 was able to do 
                    substantial damage to the Japanese at the end of the Second World War.
