                <p>
                    The First World War (1914-1918) was the first major military conflict in which aviation and airpower was widely used. Although flight was still in its 
                    infancy towards the beginning of the war, the technology greatly progressed as the war continued, driven by a need for quick innovation. Even a small 
                    technological upper hand could make a huge difference. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, leading to a rapidly escalating series of conflicts in Europe. Alliances resulted in the 
                    Allied and Central Powers. Civilian morale was high and a deadly worldwide conflict ensued over the next several years. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reconnaissance was the primary role of aviation during the war, and especially during its early stages. Aircraft and engines weren't strong at all 
                    and could at most carry their own weight and maybe one or two people. As such, they were used mainly to fly above the battlefield and provide 
                    information to people on the ground, who could make informed strategic decisions. Lighter-than-air balloons were also used for reconnaissance, but they 
                    were quickly phased out by their fixed-wing counterparts. Balloons were large targets that could easily be shot down. 
                </p>

                <p><small>The Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.5 was a fixed-wing biplane two-seat reconnaissance aircraft used by Britain during the First World War. In 1914, it 
                    set an altitude record by flying to almost 19,000 feet. Public Domain. </small></p>

            <div class="col">
                <p>
                    Most early airplanes were in pusher configuration - that is, the engines and propellers were behind or next to the pilots. The advantages of this 
                    configuration were that they allowed pilots good visibility, which was paramount since the aircraft were being used for reconnaissance. However, 
                    the tractor configuration (engine and propeller in front) gained in popularity. Although the visibility was now obstructed, the tractor configuration 
                    allowed for heavier and better engines to be placed on aircraft, causing a large increase in performance. This became the standard and preferred design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Better performance and more powerful engines led to new, unique uses of aviation during the war. As aircraft could carry increased loads, the first 
                    cases of aerial bombings came to be. Initially, it only consisted of pilots throwing hand grenades or small bombs out of their aircraft. However, 
                    larger and larger bombs could be loaded into aircraft and dropped, allowing for strategic bombing. Bombings were hindered by a lack of accurate aiming 
                    echnology and poor navigational equipment. The Germans also used Zeppelins to bomb the British, but they were large, easy, highly flammable targets 
                    whose effects mostly included civilian terrorization. 
                </p>

                <p><small>
                    The Gotha G.V was a twin-engine pusher configuration bomber used by Germany during the First World War for long-range night bombing operations. 
                    It featured a dedicated bomb compartment and a tunnel a gunman could use to operate weaponry aimed below the aircraft. Public domain.

            <div class="col-lg-8">
                <p>
                    Increased load carrying capacity also led to fighter aircraft and the first cases of direct aerial warfare. Initially, pilots from opposing armies 
                    avoided fighting each other directly. However, pilots soon began to carry pistols and shotguns with them, with the intent of shooting at other 
                    aircraft. The guns were slow and inaccurate, and rarely did the shots hit where intended. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Machine guns were the solution. They were already being used widely on the ground, so why not add them onto airplanes? The task wasn't so simple. 
                    Adding a machine gun onto a pusher aircraft would be difficult as the engines weren't powerful enough to carry such a load. Adding machine guns onto 
                    tractor aircraft resulted in the bullets hitting the propeller and shooting it off. The French solved that problem by adding metal shields onto the 
                    backs of the propellor blades to deflect the shots that hit it. Unfortunately, this did not work for the Germans whose steel bullets shattered the 
                    guards, unlike the copper bullets used by the French. 
                </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <p>
                    Problems require solutions, and need drives innovation. The Germans invented a new piece of technology called the interrupter. Aptly named, it 
                    prevents machine guns from firing when the propeller blocks it. This allowed for increasingly powerful fighter jets. Fighter aircraft also led to 
                    formation flying, in which aircraft could guard each other by flying near each other. Fighter aircraft also led to a series of aces, who attempted 
                    to shoot down as many enemy aircraft as possible. One of the most famous aces of the First World War was Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen, 
                    better known as the Red Baron. He was able to shoot down 80 enemy aircraft during the war, and died in battle in 1918. Canada's Billy Bishop who shot 
                    down 72 enemy aircraft now has an airport in Toronto named after him.

                    So just how important was aviation during the war? Historians often have mixed opinions. Some take the stance that because aviation and airpower were 
                    still in early development, they didn't play an important role in the war. Others believe that airpower was decisive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's certainly true that aviation was still in its infancy at the time of the war, but the war made it so that countries needed to rapidly improve 
                    and develop their technologies so that it could be used more effectively. During the war, people were well aware of the advantages that aviation 
                    gave to those who had it, and they dealt with it accordingly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the Battle of Verdun, the Germans were aware of French reconnaissance aircraft and attempted to trick them as they were preparing for the battle. 
                    They also tried to block them from the air. German reconnaissance aircraft allowed them some advance knowledge of what would happen at the Battle of 
                    the Somme, which may have been a factor in the deadly stalemate that ensued. At the end of the war, the Treaty of Versailles banned Germany from having 
                    any military aviation at all. If aviation wasn't important to the First World War, then why did the Allies try to permanently destroy Germany's military 
                    aviation?

                    As the first major military conflict in which airpower was widely used, the First World War was an impetus that led to a boom in aviation technology 
                    development. It led to stronger engines, better airframes, and new technologies altogether. As the war came to an end, people began to realize just 
                    how effective aviation was in military applications, and that it would completely change the way future wars were fought.
