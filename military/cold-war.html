                <p>
                    During the Cold War, improvements in aviation technology were important in ensuring that each 
                    side could effectively fight, should a conflict arise. Thus, a fierce aviation and nuclear arms 
                    race ensued between the US and Soviets, as a part of the general deterrence strategy of the era. 
                    Stealth aircraft became important for the first time, as both the Soviets and Americans needed 
                    to conduct reconnaissance, but conventional aircraft are easily detectable and shot down. Though 
                    the first stealth-centered aircraft (the F-117) didn't come along until the 1980s, earlier Cold 
                    War technologies represent the first attempts to delay or avoid enemy detection. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft created by the air force was the Lockheed U-2 
                    "Dragon Lady". The U-2 was designed as a high-and-fast spy plane, and its purpose was to take aerial 
                    photos. The U-2 was able to conduct a number of successful missions, especially ones that flew well 
                    into Soviet airspace. However, on May 1, 1960, a U-2 was shot down and the pilot, Francis Gary Powers, 
                    was captured. This was a key event during the war, as previous attempts at diffusing tensions proved 
                    to be a failure. The US government had designed the aircraft to self-destruct upon such an occurrence, 
                    and the pilot was supposed to commit suicide. As such, the US claimed that the aircraft was a weather 
                    research aircraft that had gone astray and crashed. 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8">
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the Soviets knew otherwise, as the wreckage was quite intact, the pilot was alive, and 
                    the Soviets had pictures of the surveillance technology onboard. However, Khrushchev avoided directly 
                    finger-pointing at Eisenhower, instead blaming the Pentagon. Eisenhower had the option to blame the 
                    incident on the Pentagon, but he took personal responsibility. This was done in fear of making it seem 
                    like he had lost control over his own government, which would have numerous international and domestic 
                    repercussions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the incident, U-2s were stopped from flying such missions over Soviet airspace. However, U-2s 
                    were still flying elsewhere. Notably, a U-2 was shot down during the Cuban Missile Crisis by a 
                    surface-to-air missile (SAM), on October 27, 1962. The CIA had pilots flying reconnaissance missions over 
                    Cuba to assess the state of their missile technology. When the aircraft was shot down, it was one of the 
                    most tense moments of the crisis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time, President Kennedy was confused, as he did not think Khrushchev had authorized the shooting. 
                    Until this point, it seemed that Khrushchev wanted a diplomatic solution, but to Kennedy, this was an 
                    escalation in the conflict. The Americans planned to retaliate with an airstrike in three days, knowing full 
                    well that doing so could cause an all-out nuclear war. Thankfully, we know that didn't happen, and they were 
                    able to deescalate the situation.

                    It was the incident with the U-2 over the Soviet Union, however, that displayed the need for a more effective 
                    piece of technology that could better evade Soviet defenses. This led to the creation of the A-12 program, which 
                    tried to create a better spy plane that could fly higher and faster. It offered numerous technological advances, 
                    such as titanium skin and an absorbent paint that could decrease its radar footprint. It was such a great aircraft 
                    that Elon Musk included it as part of his child's name. The A-12 was redesigned as the SR-71, which offered a 
                    second seat and extra fuel capacity. The SR-71 currently holds the aircraft speed record at 2,193 miles per hour.
