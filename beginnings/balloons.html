                    In 1678, Issac Newton published his Principia Mathematica where he derived the basis of the drag equation, which is crucial to modern
                    aerodynamic calculations. It wasn’t until the year 1709 that the next major accomplishment in aviation was achieved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bartolomeu de Gusmão was a Brazilian priest who pioneered the design of lighter-than-air aircraft. He is best known for planning a
                    bird-like airship that would be lifted using hot air. Unfortunately, it was never built. Often overlooked, his most important contribution
                    to aviation was the demonstration of a working hot air balloon. He was invited before the king in which his small hot air balloon
                    flew indoors for a short period of time before it was extinguished in fear of fire.

                <p>
                    Nearly seventy years later, the Montgolfier brothers came along. Jacques-Etienne and Joseph-Michel Montgolfier became well known for
                    their experiments in building and flying large scale hot air balloons. In 1783 they were the first to make a manned flight in a balloon,
                    and did so by burning wool and straw under the canopy - much like modern day hot air balloons which use propane instead. Although their work came such
                    a while later than the work of Gusmão, many people falsely believe that the Montgolfier brothers were the first to fly a hot air balloon. Indeed,
                    the brothers are much more well documented and appreciated for their contributions to aviation than Gusmão.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later that year, the chemist Jacques Charles was inspired by the Montgolfiers, who had become quite famous in France. The recent chemical revolution
                    made it known to scientists that hydrogen gas was lighter than air and could operate on a similar principle to a balloon. He constructed a hydrogen
                    balloon and called it Le Globe. Its flight was a success, until the landing in which villagers attacked and destroyed it, not knowing what it was.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>
                    Fascinated by such flights, more people became balloonists, popularizing the concept and spreading it around the world. One such man was Jean-Pierre
                    Blanchard. His balloons were not unique, but he became the first to deliver international mail by air, from England to France.
                    Additionally, he brought ballooning to North America with a flight from Philadelphia to New Jersey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The creation of balloons also led to the creation of the first air force - the <em>Compagnie des Aerostiers</em>, or "Company of Aeronauts" in France.
                    Fifty men formed the company, who used balloons to observe and communicate with infantry soldiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the creation of the balloon, aviation really began to take hold in the world. Evidently, its potential to be used for both transport and military
                    was noticed and utilized almost immediately. Today, the legacy of the balloon is carried on through applications like weather observation, and leisure balloon flights.
