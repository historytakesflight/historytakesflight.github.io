                    Most people have heard of the Wright brothers and that fateful day in 1903 when they flew their 
                    powered airplane for the first time. But what got them interested in flight?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It all starts with their childhood. Wilbur Wright was born in April 1867, and Orville was born 
                    four years later in August. Their father, Milton, was a minister, who would often take extended trips away from his family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a young age, the Wrights were encouraged to learn about anything that interested them. In fact, Orville later realized 
                    that without this nurturing environment, they may not have ever decided to pursue aviation:

                        We were lucky enough to grow up in an environment where there was always much encouragement to children to pursue intellectual 
                        interests; to investigate whatever aroused curiosity. In a different kind of environment, our curiosity might have been nipped 
                        long before it could have borne fruit.

                <p>
                    One day in 1878, upon returning home from a trip, Milton gave the boys a toy helicopter, powered by a rubber band. Upon being 
                    thrown in the air, the helicopter did not fall to the ground, but “struck the ceiling, where it fluttered awhile, and finally 
                    sank to the floor”. The young children were fascinated by it. Although it quickly broke, Wilbur and Orville never forgot about it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several years later, in 1896, Orville became bedridden with typhoid fever. Coincidentally, Otto Lilienthal, another aviation 
                    pioneer, had died around the same time in a gliding accident. During that time, Wilbur and their sister Katharine spent long 
                    amounts of time taking care of Orville. Wilbur read aloud about Otto Lilienthal and his gliding experiments. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being avid readers, the Wright brothers became very interested in flight, and quickly exhausted the resources available to 
                    them. In 1899, Wilbur Wright wrote to the Smithsonian Institution, requesting any available materials they might be able to supply to him.

                    Otto Lilienthal, Louis Pierre Moulliard, and others.
                    Now fully interested in the problem of flight, the Wright brothers read works by other aeronautical pioneers, such as Octave Chanute, Samuel Langley, 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1901, the Wright brothers personally met Octave Chanute, who proved to be a valuable mentor in their experiments. Chanute took great interest in 
                    the developments of the Wright brothers and was immediately able to see the potential they had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout their development of their gliders and airplanes, Wilbur and Orville never shied away from the importance of research. They never ceased 
                    to consult other publications and pioneers of flight. If it were not for those who came before them, the Wright brothers likely would not 
                    have found the success that they achieved. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On December 17th, 1903, the Wright brothers’ work finally paid off with the first powered, controlled flight.
