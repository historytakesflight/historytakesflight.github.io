                <p>
                    The 19th century was a busy time for aviation. Balloons and lighter-than-air aircraft continued to develop
                    following their creation in the 18th century, resulting in longer and higher flights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In November 1836, a new record for distance and duration in flight was set when a balloon was flown from
                    England to Germany over eighteen hours. The first hypoxia deaths occurred then in 1875, when the balloon
                    <em>Zenith</em> ascended to over 28,000 feet. Two out of three passengers died, and the remaining man was left deaf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While killing some, balloons ended up saving the lives of many. In 1870, Paris was under siege during the
                    Franco-Prussian War. Completely surrounded, the Parisians had no way of escaping or communicating with the
                    outside world without facing almost certain death. Thankfully, they had balloons, which they used to airlift
                    people and mail out of Paris.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Balloons aside, the most important achievements of the 19th century involved gliders and heavier-than-air aircraft.
                    These developments would ultimately lead to the airplane we know today.

                <p>
                    It starts with a man named <strong>William Samuel Henson</strong>, who followed George Cayley in his studies of gliders.
                    In 1843 he was able to patent a steam engine driven monoplane, but did not get the chance to fly it, as his work was
                    unfortunately cut short due to a lack of money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, in 1866, <strong>Francis Herbert Wenham</strong> studied wing shapes and aerodynamics and became the first
                    lecturer to the Royal Aeronautical Society which had recently been formed. With <strong>John Browning</strong>, he created
                    the first wind tunnel, which enabled further scientific research in aerodynamics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several other engineers attempted to create gliders and powered aircraft, with varying degrees of success. One of the most
                    notable of these contributors was <strong>Otto Lilienthal</strong>. Lilienthal began his work by researching aerodynamics,
                    particularly those of birds. His results were published in <em>Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation</em> in 1889. His main contributions
                    however, were in the form of gliders, which he flew multiple times with great success. His work was directly helpful to the
                    Wright brothers. His legacy is honored today with his name displayed on the side of Berlin-Tegel Airport.
                </p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>
                    Next, we see a man who dedicated much of his life to furthering flight. <strong>Octave Chanute</strong> built gliders himself,
                    but is known for taking a philanthropic approach to aviation. He acted as a fact-checker in aviation, discerning false claims
                    from real ones. In addition, he was able to see potential in some engineers and donated to those in need. In 1894, Chanute
                    published a comprehensive review of flight, <em>Progress in Flying Machines</em>, in which he acknowledges those who studied flight
                    and those who tried building aircraft. When the Wright brothers were experimenting with flight, Octave Chanute was instrumental
                    in counseling them and helping them to succeed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the Wright brothers were progressing towards flight, they had a lesser known competitor - <strong>Samuel Langley</strong>.
                    He was also trying to fly a powered airplane, and came awfully close to doing so, even before the Wright brothers were able to.
                    His design may have been feasible, save for the fatal flaw that he was catapulting them into the air - it caused too much stress
                    on the structure of the aircraft and ultimately led to failure. Samuel Langley gave up on aviation just nine days before the Wright
                    brothers made their historic flight in Kitty Hawk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 19th century was full of successes and failures in the field of aviation. Lighter-than-air aircraft saw improvements in flight duration
                    and distance. Building off the work of George Cayley, a plethora of scientists and engineers worked independently and sometimes collaboratively
                    to build, test, and improve heavier than air gliders and model airplanes. The work of these gifted people both directly and indirectly
                    influenced the success of the Wright brothers.
