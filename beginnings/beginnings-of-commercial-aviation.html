                    As flight technology became <a href="./longer-distances.html">increasingly reliable</a>, the potential for profit became apparent. Surely enough, people took advantage of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first passenger airline was DELAG (<em>Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft</em>), which used airships to create a robust network of global 
                    air transport. The airline was started in 1909 offering flights within Germany. It was also the first airline to fly passengers across the 
                    atlantic. Flights were luxurious and expensive, with a flight from Frankfurt to New York costing $400 (now worth about $6,000). Unfortunately, 
                    the Hindenburg disaster instantly wiped out the airship industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first heavier-than-air airline was short lived, only offering service for about three months in 1914. The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat line provided 
                    regularly scheduled cargo and passenger flights from St. Petersburg to Tampa, Florida using Benoist XIV flying boats. The geographic advantages of this 
                    particular route may have been the sole reason it lasted as long as it did. A twenty-three minute flight was all it took to jump over the Tampa Bay, but 
                    the same route would have taken eleven hours by rail. The airline ceased operations lacking the funds to continue.

                <p>
                    However, the first heavier-than-air commercial flights began with airmail. Aviation had become increasingly prominent in America, and people saw the potential 
                    for faster, more efficient transportation of mail. On September 23rd, 1911, Earle Ovington piloted the first authorized US Airmail flight from Garden City Estates, 
                    NY to Mineola, NY. He was followed by 7 other pilots. Although this was a one-time event, it served as a major proof of concept, securing faith in reliable 
                    transportation of mail by aircraft. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In May of 1918, Army Air Service pilots began the first scheduled airmail flights, which operated once daily from New York City to Washington, D.C. via Philadelphia. 
                    Service began using the Curtiss JN-4H "Jenny," which was originally used to train pilots during World War I. After three months, the Post Office took over airmail 
                    services and used civilian pilots and aircraft made by the Standard Aircraft Corporation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As airmail became more and more effective, new routes were added, forming a network connecting mail rapidly across the country. Transcontinental airmail routes also 
                    brought about the first regularly scheduled night flights. New infrastructure also came about in the form of airfields and navigational light towers. 
                </p>

            <div class="col-md">
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most famous airmail pilot was Charles Lindbergh, who made history in 1927 with the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight. He became an instant celebrity 
                    upon returning to the US, bringing aviation to the forefront of the American mind. Some historians believe that among other factors, Charles Lindbergh’s fame caused a 
                    jump start in the aviation industry, inspiring many to start new airlines and companies in the late 1920s. On October 29, 1929, the stock market crashed and the Great 
                    Depression began. In an overall state of economic despair, most industries suffered greatly with widespread unemployment and bankruptcies. Make no mistake, the aviation 
                    industry suffered too, but surprisingly not as much. This was perhaps due to demand in the military, as well as later New Deal programs such as the 
                    <abbr title="Works Progress Administration">WPA</abbr>, <abbr title="Public Works Administration">PWA</abbr>, <abbr title="Civil Works Administration">CWA</abbr>, 
                    <abbr title="Federal Emergency Relief Act">FERA</abbr>, and more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the aviation industry robustly situated in the American economy, it was well poised to change both transportation and the armed forces, which it did indeed.
