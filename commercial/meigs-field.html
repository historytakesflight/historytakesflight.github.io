        <h1>The infamous story of Meigs Field, Chicago</h1>

                <p>
                    Meigs Field was one of the most well known and beloved general aviation airports in the United States. Built in 1948, it quickly became the busiest single-runway airport in the US by 1955. With its close proximity to downtown Chicago, it was a popular choice for private pilots, businesspeople, and politicians. It was so popular that it became an icon to aviators and community members alike. Meigs field was built on Northerly Island, which was originally an island in Lake Michigan until it was converted into a peninsula through a WPA project. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Mayor Richard Daley had long wished for the airport to be closed and converted into a park. He tried it first in 1996 by painting large Xs on the runway, but his action was quickly overturned by the Illinois State Legislature. In 2003, Daley decided he'd had enough. Under the cover of night, the police escorted bulldozers who gouged large Xs into the runway, rendering it permanently inoperable. News and media were steered away from the area, and nearby security cameras were blocked with light beams. By morning, the damage was apparent: an airport destroyed and 16 aircraft stranded.

                    Although Daley played the counterterrorism card when offering an explanation for his actions, it was quite clear that his main motivation was that Northerly Island become a park. The same mayor had fought to expand O'Hare airport, and in doing so, agreed to keep Meigs Field open until 2026. Clearly, he knew that he was doing something he wasn't supposed to be doing, hence the efforts to keep it a secret. The FAA requires a 30 day notice before an airport closure, which Daley failed to give before tearing it up. They were fined thirty three thousand dollars for that. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    The 16 stranded aircraft were eventually evacuated via the parallel taxiway, and work began on the island to turn it into a park. Yet, ten years after the airport was closed, proponents of the park were less than satisfied with the progress. It soon became apparent that the conversion would take several years and millions of dollars. More recent efforts to restore Northerly Island were largely rejected due to high costs. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the park was closed, and rising water levels in Lake Michigan are causing soil erosion, which could result in the permanent closure of the park.

                <p>
                    Though Mayor Daley's actions were unpopular, some people supported the closure of the airport. In fact, many GA airports around the country threaten to close, ultimately because of the outspoken voices of a few people who oppose them. High rates of noise complaints lead to increasingly stringent noise abatement procedures, though noise complaints are often found to be non-representative of the overall opinion of community members. Higher restrictions on airport use leads to overall traffic to decrease, which in turn decreases the income for small airports (through fees but also federal grants), which can ultimately shut down an airport for good. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    A decrease in GA operations will ultimately cause harm in local economies, as well as the greater commercial aviation industry. Because all aspiring pilots must train using GA aircraft and GA airports, a decrease in availability will make flight training more exclusive, inaccessible, and expensive, which will result in a decrease in available pilots that might otherwise work at airlines and other essential aviation jobs.
