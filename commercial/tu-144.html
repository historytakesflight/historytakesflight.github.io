                    You've probably heard of Concorde, the widely popularized and romanticized supersonic transport jet. But did you know that the Soviet Union had one of their 
                    own? The Tupolev Tu-144 actually came before Concorde - but why did it fail?

                </p>
                <p>
                    The issues with the Tu-144 were as much technical as political. The Tu-144 was designed during  the late 1960s, at the height of a fierce technology race 
                    between the USSR and the US during the Cold War. This time, however, it was a competition with Europe. The Soviets expended much energy, time, and money into 
                    the Tu-144 project, conducting research and development. They wanted to have the project completed as quickly as possible, so they kept increasing their 
                    investments in it. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    The result makes you do a double-take - it looks so much like Concorde. In December of 1968, the Tu-144 had its maiden flight - two years before Concorde did. 
                    It featured retractable canard wings, an extendable nose cone, and four afterburner turbojet engines. Concorde had a remarkably similar design, with an 
                    extendable nose cone, four afterburner turbojet engines, and delta-wing configuration. It did not have retractable canards, and it could turn off its afterburners, 
                    unlike the Tu-144. When landing, the Tu-144, with insufficient braking power, needed to use parachutes to slow itself down.

            <div class="col-lg-5">

                    The Tu-144 got off to a rocky start. At the Paris Air Show in 1973, the airplane crashed. Whether this incident was due to pilot error or an engineering flaw, 
                    it certainly was not a good look for the aircraft, especially in its direct competition with Concorde, which was also at the same airshow. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Once it started carrying passengers in 1977, the Tu-144 was further riddled with problems. Mainly, the cabin was loud. Airplanes aren't known to be quiet 
                    machines, but it was exceptionally bad here. The passengers could not hear each other talk or shout, and resorted to passing notes for communication. The 
                    Tu-144 would not have been well-suited for long haul operations either. The always-activated afterburners, as well as the heavy weight of the aircraft made 
                    it a gas-guzzling beast that would not have gotten far without needing to refuel. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    After flying just one hundred and two commercial flights, 55 with passengers, the Tu-144 was retired after a short-lived operational history amidst a political 
                    embarrassment. Concorde went on to fly until 2003. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't the end of the Tu-144 though. After the Cold War ended, the US decided they wanted to collaborate with Russia on mutually beneficial research projects, 
                    one of which involved supersonic transport. In 1998 and 1999, the collaborative project went according to plan, and researchers were able to gather valuable data 
                    regarding supersonic transport. After the program ended, the aircraft has never flown since.
